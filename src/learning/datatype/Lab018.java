        // Truncation-
        /*You might expect the result to be 3.5, but because both numbers are integers, truncation occurs, and the fractional part (.5) is dropped. The result stored in result will be 3 instead of 3.5.

                How to Avoid Truncation:
        To avoid truncation, you can cast one of the numbers to a floating-point type (like double or float), which allows the fractional part to be preserved:

        java
        Copy code
        double result = 7 / 2.0;  // Using a floating-point number
        This will correctly output 3.5 because the division is now done with a floating-point number.

                In your code, the expression (((a * b) / c) * d) could suffer from truncation if you donâ€™t handle the division carefully, as a * b and c are integers. By casting one of them to double, you avoid truncation.*/
